              I started studying at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nazarenelegazpi/?rf=917782768252006"><u>Nazarene Elementary and Kindergarten School</u></a> or NEKS until Preparatory Level. Then I was transferred to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlbayCS114457/"><u>Albay Central School</u></a> on Grade 1 until Grade 2. I was transferred back to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nazarenelegazpi/?rf=917782768252006"><u>NEKS</u></a> because of my poor performance on my 2nd grade. Until then I finished my Elementary Level there.

            <p class="lead">
              I started studying Junior High School on <a href="https://www.dwc-legazpi.edu/"><u>Divine Word College of Legazpi</u></a> or DWCL. On my Grade 7 days, I had a rough experience because I was being bullied until I got to Grade 8, I had circle of friends, no one bullies me anymore and had a fun Junior High School Life until I moved up to Senior High School.

              Senior High School life, is a new experience. It's where you prepare once you got in college life. You pick what strand you want and giving you assignments almost like what college do. I still study in <a href="https://www.dwc-legazpi.edu/"><u>DWCL</u></a> I had a good experience in my Senior High School Life and finished my Senior High School Level.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Now that I graduated College and this is my educational attainment so far. I still can't believe that I've done this. Life is indeed an adventure and I just go with the flow.
